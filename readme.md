## Main goal of this project: 

Build from Scratch an application using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components.

## Pages: 

There are four pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage.

**Note:** Some pages are using **protected routes** with auth listeners. **Firebase firestore** handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook. The authentication feature is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

## Design Pattern: 

The design pattern being used is **compound components** to build components. The styling is all handled via **styled components**. Using compound components is really easy to test.
